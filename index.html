									<h3>What is Atlas:Earth?</h3>
									<p>Atlas:Earth is the leading virtual real estate app that lets you buy real-world land parcels on a virtual map. As the top app in the metaverse for real estate, it enables users to earn passive income, known as rent, from their property investments. You can purchase these land parcels based on your real-world location, making it a unique way to earn money. Initially launched in the United States, Atlas:Earth has expanded its reach and is now available globally as of 2024. </p>
									<h4>Can You Actually Make Money with Atlas:Earth?</h4>
									<p>Absolutely! While Atlas Earth won’t make you rich overnight, it offers a way to earn passive income through virtual real estate. As you acquire and manage land parcels, you’ll start generating steady income that continues to grow over time. Initially, you might see small earnings, but with patience and strategic expansion, your income can increase to a few dollars per week. Stick with it, and your investments will start to pay off!</p>
                                    <h4>Do I need to spend money?</h4>
                                    <p>NO!  The rent you accumulate for your parcels is basically generated from a share in advertising revenue.  There are options to purchase Atlas Dollars, but you really do not need to use your real world money to advance in this game.</p>
                                    <h4>How do I install Atlas:Earth?</h4>
                                    <p>You can download the app here: <a href="https://r.atlasearth.com/WgVkoQigxMb" target="_blank">Atlas:Earth</a></p>

									<h3>How to Earn Free Atlas Bucks in Atlas:Earth</h3>
									<p>  Atlas Bucks (AB) are the essential in-game currency in Atlas:Earth, enabling you to buy land parcels and start earning passive income (rent). Upon creating your account, you’ll receive an initial 100 AB. To maximize your earnings and accumulate more Atlas Bucks quickly, follow these effective strategies for earning free AB:</p>
									<h4>1. Referrals</h4>
                                    <p>Use a referral link or code when you first sign up.  If your friends aren’t playing yet, feel free to use my link (<a href="https://r.atlasearth.com/WgVkoQigxMb" target="_blank">click here</a>) or enter my referral code (<strong>337U20</strong>) into your settings (tap your user icon in the top-left corner, then select the settings icon).  Joining with a referral will give you 200 AB once you’ve acquired your 10th parcel.</p>
                                    <p>Essentially, it’s a <strong>20% bonus</strong>.  Once you’ve joined, send your referral code to your contacts.  As the referrer, you will receive 10 AB every time your friend acquires a new parcel.</p>
                                    <h4>2. Register your phone number</h4>
                                    <p>This can be done in the settings (tap your icon in the top-left), and you will receive 100 AB.  If you agree to receive text messages, you will get another 50 AB.  <strong>NOTE:</strong> I was hesitant to do this at first, but at the time of writing this (nearly 3 months into playing) I have not received a single text from Atlas:Earth.</p>
                                    <h4>3. Advertisements</h4>
                                    <p>Click on the <strong>SHOP</strong> icon in the bottom-left, then choose the <strong>FREE</strong> icon.  You can generate 1 AB every 20 minutes.  Obviously, you don’t need to sit there actually watching the ad.  Just tap the icon, put your phone down and come back 30 seconds or so later.  Outside of the US, you will earn 1 AB for every ad watched.  Inside the US,  you earn 2 AB for every ad. </p>
                                    <h4>4. Daily login bonus</h4>
                                    <p>Tap the <strong>calendar</strong> icon on the right side, then tap the daily bonus.  Most days provide 1 AB, but there are milestone rewards (e.g. 8 AB on day 7, 25 AB on day 14, etc.).  <strong>NOTE:</strong> Daily bonuses only begin after you have acquired 3 parcels. See also <strong>Atlas Explorer Club</strong>. </p>
                                    <h4>5. Diamond wheel spin</h4>
                                    <p>As you travel around IRL, keep an eye on the in-game map.  You will frequently spot diamonds that you can collect by tapping on them.  Once you have some diamonds, you can spend them on wheel spins found in the <strong>EVENTS</strong> icon (bottom of the screen).  You can spin the wheel up to five times per day to earn AB.  The last two spins require playing advertisements.</p>
                                    <h4>6. Atlas Arcade</h4>
                                    <p>This is where things get a bit &quot;grindy&quot;, but it pays off (literally). And some of the games are actually fun. Tap the <strong>SHOP</strong> icon and scroll down to the <strong>ATLAS ARCADE</strong> icon.  This will take you to a page with a selection of third-party apps.  Choose an app and read what the requirements are to earn AB.</p>
                                    <h4>7. Surveys</h4>
                                    <p>Tap the <strong>SHOP</strong> icon, scroll down and select the <strong>SURVEYS FOR BUCKS</strong> icon.  This one frustrates a lot of folks in the community, as a LOT of surveys will kick you out part-way through.  However, I have had a bit of luck completing some of them, and quite a few will still provide you with 1 AB after failing.  It’s worth trying periodically, and not a very big time commitment.</p>
                                    <h4>8. Purchasing Atlas Bucks</h4>
                                    <p>You do NOT have to do this to earn money.  In fact, it will likely take a VERY long time to recoup any money that you put into this game.  However, depending on what you want to get out of Atlas Earth, you may decide it’s worth it to purchase AB from time to time.  If your motivation is not financial gain, but rather bragging rights and/or just enjoying collecting land parcels for fun, then this may be the route for you.  Various AB packs can be found in the SHOP icon. </p>

									<h3>Buying Virtual Real-Estate (Parcels) in Atlas:Earth</h3>
									<p>Once you have acquired enough Atlas Bucks, you can purchase parcels within your real-time location radius.  Each unowned parcel costs 100 AB.  Simply tap the <strong>BUY LAND</strong> icon on the bottom of the main screen in the app, then tap on the grid square that you would like to purchase.  Select <strong>&quot;Buy Land&quot;</strong>, then confirm your decision on the pop-up. </p>
									<h4>Land Rarities and Values</h4>
									<p>Each parcel that you purchase will be randomly assigned one of four possible rarities.  The rarity of your parcel will determine the amount of rent it produces.  The rarities and their associated rent values are:</p>
									<ul>
									  <li>Common (50% chance): $0.0000000011  per second</li>
									  <li>Rare (30% chance): $0.0000000016  per second</li>
									  <li>Epic (15% chance): $0.0000000022  per second</li>
									  <li>Legendary (5% chance): $0.0000000044  per second</li>

							  <div class="container">
								<h3>Rent Boosting to Increase PassivIncome</h3>
								  <p>Boosting your rent is absolutely crucial for earning real-world money in Atlas:Earth.  Boosts multiply your parcel income depending on the number of parcels owned, and you can stack your boosts for up to 6 hours at a time.  For a  breakdown of boost multipliers, <a href="https://atlasreality.helpshift.com/hc/en/3-atlas-earth/faq/39-why-do-ad-boosts-change-and-how-do-i-see-my-current-boost-rate/" target="_blank">see here</a>.</p>
								  <p>To activate your boost multiplier, simply tap the BOOST icon in the top-right corner of the app, then select WATCH AD.  As always, you can just set your phone down and check back a minute later instead of subjecting yourself to the ads. </p>
								  <p><strong>NOTE: </strong>Once a month or so, Atlas:Earth will hold a <strong>Super Rent Boost</strong> event. These events last about 36 hours, and provide a 50x multiplier, regardless of what tier you're on.</p>

                            <section id="six">
							  <div class="container">
								<h3>Passport Bonus</h3>
								  <p>In addition to buying land parcels, you can use your Atlas Bucks to purchase passport badges. Badges are purchased through the <strong>SHOP</strong> icon. Available passport badges will be displayed here. Generally, there will be three badges available at any given location: a country badge, region/province/state badge, and a city/town badge. Adding badges to your passport will permanently increase the amount of rent per second of your land. Having 5 or more badges will also unlock the opportunity to join the <strong><a href="#seven">Atlas Explorer Club</a></strong>. </p>
								  <p>There are currently 6 passport levels:</p>
								  <ul>
								    <li><strong>Level 0:</strong> Empty passport (0% boost)</li>
								    <li><strong>Level 1:</strong> 1-10 badges (5% boost)</li>
								    <li><strong>Level 2:</strong> 11-30 badges (10% boost)</li>
								    <li><strong>Level 3:</strong> 31-60 badges (15% boost)</li>
								    <li><strong>Level 4:</strong> 61-100 badges (20% boost)</li>
								    <li><strong>Level 5:</strong> 101-9999 badges (25% boost)</li>
		                        </ul>
								  <p>The general consensus among Atlas:Earth players is that you should purchase your first passport badge soon after your 41st or 42nd parcel.
							  These bonuses will help to offset the drops in rent boosting tiers as you build your land empire.</p>
								  <p>To view your passport badges, tap your account avatar in the top-left of the screen, then elect <strong>VIEW PASSPORT</strong>.</p>

							  <div class="container">
								<h3>Atlas Explorer Club</h3>
							    <p>Once you have purchased  5 or more passport badges, you will unlock the  the <strong>Atlas Explorer Club</strong>.	This	feature	does	cost actual money, and as such it may not be for everyone. As noted previously, it will take a very long time to recoup any real-world mony that you put into this game. However, if you are thinking about purchasing additional Atlas Bucks, the Explorer Club is by far the most cost-effective way to do so. </p>
							    <p>The club works as a monthly subscription ($49.99), which can be cancelled at any time. The club provides an additional daily AB bonus alongside the Daily Login Bonus. Like the Daily Login Bonus, there are extra bonuses at regular intervals, including a 1200 AB bonus on day 90. These bonuses are collected in addition to those of the regular Daily Login. </p>
							    <p>At the time of writing this, the Explorer Club cannot be joined within the app. To join the club, visit the official <a href="https://r.atlasearth.com/WgVkoQigxMb" target="_blank">Atlas:Earth website</a>. </p>
